<p>„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§Hey, I'm Rauf, a grade 11 student currently attending George S Henry Academy. You may find me cruising on my bike, checking out new food spots, or watching movies. My career asperations include sectors in either business or engineering. As I navigate through highschool, my hobbies or my pursuit to advance towards my career asperations define what I do throughout my day to day life.</p>
